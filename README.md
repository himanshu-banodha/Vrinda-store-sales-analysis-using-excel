# Vrinda Store Sales Analysis using MS Excel

![Excel-Report]()

## Objective / Problem statement:
Vrinda store wants to create an annual sales report for the year 2022. So that, its management can understand their customer's behaviour & increase sales in 2023.

**Here are the key areas I addressed:**

* Which month got the highest sales and orders?
* Who purchased more – men or women?
* What are the different order statuses in 2022?
* List the top 10 states contributing to the sales.
* What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?
* Which channel is contributing the maximum to the sales?

## Steps:
* Data Cleaning
* Data Processing
* Data Analysis
* Dashboard
* Insights 

## Insights:
* Women are more likely to buy in comparison to men (~65%)
* Maharashtra, Karnataka & Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states with the highest sales.
* The adult age group (30-49 yrs) is maximum contributing to the sales.
* Maximum orders are coming from Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart.

## Learnings:
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering and data preparation
* Used different types of charts to analyse the data, such as bar charts, pie charts, clustered bar charts & slicers.
* Created an interactive dashboard to track & analyse sales data using MS Excel
